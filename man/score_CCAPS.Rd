\title{Score the CCAPS subscales from CCAPS items}
\usage{
score_CCAPS(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data file containing CCAPS item data}
}
\value{
A data frame with all the original data in \code{data}, and several additional columns: \code{Has_CCAPS}, \code{Is_CCAPS62}, \code{Is_ValidCCAPS}, \code{Is_ValidCCAPS62}, \code{Is_CCAPS34}, \code{Is_ValidCCAPS34}, \code{Depression34}, \code{Anxiety34}, \code{Social_Anxiety34}, \code{Academics34}, \code{Eating34}, \code{Hostility34}, \code{Alcohol34}, \code{DI}, \code{Depression62}, \code{Eating62}, \code{Substance62}, \code{Anxiety62}, \code{Hostility62}, \code{Social_Anxiety62}, \code{Family62}, \code{Academics62}
}
\description{
Scores the CCAPS subscales for valid CCAPS administrations.
}
\note{
\code{score_CCAPS} calls on CCAPS items by name, so they must be named properly in
\code{data}. Variable naming convention is \code{CCAPS_01}... \code{CCAPS_70}.
If 'data does not contain the proper CCAPS variable names
(or the naming convention was changed in the new year's data), the
function will return an error.
Administrations are considered valid and will be scored if 1/3 or less of the items on any subscale are missing, and if less than
1/2 of the data overall is missing, and if the variance of the items is > 0, indicating that the items were not all marked
as the same number.
Function does not overwrite CCAPS items to reverse score them. It creates new reverse scored version, which it then deletes.
Note that this takes several minutes to run.
